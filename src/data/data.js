        text:"It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto’s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.Its about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that theres no driver at the wheel.During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. “Did it make you feel uncomfortable?,” asks the vehicle’s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",

        text:"Following a traditional path used by traders and invaders, the Georgian Military Road has been a passageway for people and ideas since antiquity.As my car snakes its way through the Georgian Military Road, a 210km route that twists and turns through Georgia's Caucasus Mountains, I am greeted by lush valleys crisscrossed by gurgling rivers, mountains overgrown with wildflowers and picturesque villages perched on the edge of cliffs. Occasional Georgian Orthodox churches, complete with beautiful barrel domes, appear on the horizon and rows of coloured Soviet mosaics adorn deserted bus stop walls. At one stop, a smiling vendor breaks into song as he hands me a plate of Georgian dumplings by the shimmering blue Aragvi River.Sixteen years may not signify much in other countries, but in the South Caucasian country of Georgia, it marks the end of the five-day Russo-Georgian War of 2008 that left a trail of devastation on the Georgian Military Road. Georgia was part of the Soviet Union from 1921-1991 and the road, which connects Tbilisi with the Russian town of Vladikavkaz, is the only direct overland route connecting Georgia with the Russian Federation.",

But if something has always been on top, that does not mean that it is safe up there forever. You hear whispers; you see the rise of new languages — maybe you’re wondering,",

Although a few Microsoft MVPs are still promoting ML.NET and some other projects all the time, most of these projects are not involved in production. Usually they are used in POCs or MVP products.",
